# Rename Files with Date Prefix

Renames all files in a SharePoint document library — including files in subfolders — to prefix them with their created date in `yyMMdd` format (e.g., `251203-Status Report.pdf`). Always shows a preview before committing any changes.

## What you get

- All files prefixed with their created date in `yyMMdd` format (2-digit year, 2-digit month, 2-digit day)
- A preview table showing current names, new names, folder paths, and status before any changes are made
- Automatic skip for files already prefixed with a 6-digit date — no double-prefixing
- Recursive processing across all subfolders
- Graceful error handling — one failure does not stop the rest of the batch

## When to use

Ask Copilot:

- *"prefix all files with their created date"*
- *"add date prefixes to files"* / *"add date prefix to filenames"*
- *"rename files with date prefix"* / *"prefix filenames with yyMMdd"*
- *"prefix files in this library with their created date"*

Best on a library where you want files to sort chronologically by name. Files already prefixed with a 6-digit date are detected and skipped — the skill is safe to re-run.
