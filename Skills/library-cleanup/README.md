# Library Cleanup

Organizes a SharePoint document library by scanning for duplicates, bad file names, empty folders, and excessive nesting. Reads file content to generate meaningful rename suggestions, presents a visual before/after comparison with an Organization Score, then executes the full cleanup with a live TODO checklist.

## What you get

- A high-level summary of library issues (duplicates, bad names, empty folders, excessive nesting)
- A proposed folder structure with content-based rename suggestions derived from actual file content
- A before/after comparison table and bar chart with an **Organization Score** (0–100)
- Step-by-step execution with a live TODO checklist that updates as each action completes
- An HTML impact dashboard saved to the library showing the cleanup results

## When to use

Ask Copilot:

- *"clean up file demo"* — the primary trigger phrase
- *"clean up this library"* / *"organize this library"*
- *"fix the file names"* / *"remove duplicate files"*
- *"flatten the folder structure"*

Best on a document library that has grown organically and accumulated drafts, duplicates, vague folder names ("Stuff", "Misc", "temp"), and deep nesting. Nothing is deleted or renamed without your explicit approval of the plan.

## Demo content

Sample files for trying this skill end-to-end are in the [demo/](./demo/) subfolder. Includes an intentionally messy folder structure with bad file names, duplicates, empty folders, and excessive nesting. Skip this folder when uploading the skill to SharePoint.
